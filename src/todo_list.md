# LLM Agent Project - Next Steps

## 1. **Refinement and Enhancement**

### 1.1. **Expand Query Classification**
- [ ] **Research Additional Query Types**: Identify other common query types that users might ask (e.g., summarization, comparison, recommendations).
- [ ] **Add New Classifications**: Implement new classifications in `classify_query` to handle these additional query types.
- [ ] **Create Corresponding Templates**: Develop prompt templates for these new classifications.

### 1.2. **Improve NLP Parsing**
- [ ] **Advanced Dependency Parsing**: Integrate SpaCy’s dependency parser to better understand complex sentence structures.
- [ ] **Entity Linking**: Enhance the `parse_query` function to link recognized entities to a knowledge base for better context (e.g., linking "Python" to programming language concepts).
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate sentiment analysis to handle queries with emotional context more effectively.

### 1.3. **Optimize Prompt Generation**
- [ ] **Dynamic Template Selection**: Refine the `generate_prompt` function to dynamically select and adjust templates based on context and user feedback.
- [ ] **Handle Edge Cases**: Identify and handle specific edge cases where the generated prompts might still be awkward or unclear.

## 2. **User Interaction and Feedback**

### 2.1. **Implement User Feedback Loop**
- [ ] **Feedback Collection**: Create a simple interface or prompt where users can rate the usefulness of the generated prompt.
- [ ] **Adjust Logic Based on Feedback**: Use feedback data to refine prompt generation logic, prioritizing templates that receive higher ratings.
- [ ] **Automate Feedback Processing**: Develop a system to automatically process feedback and adjust weights or rules in the AI logic.

### 2.2. **Logging and Monitoring**
- [ ] **Add Logging**: Implement logging in the main application to track user queries and the generated prompts.
- [ ] **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Analyze logs to understand common queries and potential areas for improvement.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Ensure that errors are logged with sufficient detail to facilitate troubleshooting.

## 3. **Testing and Validation**

### 3.1. **Automated Testing**
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Key Functions**: Write unit tests for `parse_query`, `classify_query`, and `generate_prompt` functions.
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage, especially for new features or classifications added.
- [ ] **Continuous Integration**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests when new code is pushed.

### 3.2. **User Testing**
- [ ] **Gather Beta Users**: Identify a group of beta users to test the AI in real-world scenarios.
- [ ] **Collect Detailed Feedback**: Collect detailed feedback from beta users regarding the accuracy and usefulness of the prompts.
- [ ] **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine the AI based on the feedback from beta testing.

## 4. **Deployment**

### 4.1. **Web Service Deployment**
- [ ] **Choose a Framework**: Select a framework like Flask or FastAPI for deploying the AI as a web service.
- [ ] **API Development**: Develop RESTful API endpoints to expose the AI’s functionality to other applications.
- [ ] **Dockerize the Application**: Create a Docker container for easy deployment and scaling.
- [ ] **Deploy to Cloud**: Deploy the Dockerized application to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

### 4.2. **Web Interface (Optional)**
- [ ] **Build a Frontend**: Create a simple frontend interface where users can input queries and receive refined prompts.
- [ ] **Integrate with Backend**: Connect the frontend with the deployed backend API.
- [ ] **User Authentication (Optional)**: Implement user authentication if you plan to have user-specific features or analytics.

## 5. **Documentation and Maintenance**

### 5.1. **Documentation**
- [ ] **Update README.md**: Include detailed setup instructions, usage examples, and an explanation of the AI’s logic.
- [ ] **Create a Developer Guide**: Write a guide for developers who want to contribute to the project, including code structure and best practices.
- [ ] **API Documentation**: If deploying as a web service, generate API documentation using tools like Swagger.

### 5.2. **Long-Term Maintenance**
- [ ] **Regularly Review Logs**: Periodically review logs to catch any new issues or emerging usage patterns.
- [ ] **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up-to-date and compatible with the codebase.
- [ ] **Plan for Scaling**: Consider how the system will handle increased traffic or additional features as it grows.

## 6. **Exploration and Future Features**

### 6.1. **Machine Learning Integration**
- [ ] **Explore ML Models**: Investigate integrating machine learning models for query classification or even for generating more nuanced prompts.
- [ ] **Fine-Tune Language Models**: Consider fine-tuning existing language models like GPT-3 for your specific use case to improve prompt generation.
- [ ] **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing to compare the effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies.

### 6.2. **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Contextual Understanding**: Enhance the system’s ability to understand and maintain context across multiple interactions.
- [ ] **Conversation Mode**: Develop a conversation mode where the AI can ask follow-up questions to refine the prompt further.
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support**: Expand the AI to handle queries and generate prompts in multiple languages.
